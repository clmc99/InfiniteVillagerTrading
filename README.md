# EasierVillagerTrading

This is a mod for people who trade with villagers a lot. It does not add any functioniality to villagers, and it doesn't allow you to do anything you can't do in vanilla Minecraft, but it allows you to do the same things with a lot less clicks and mouse movements. Because of this, it can be used with standard, unmodded, servers, You should still check your server owner if they're ok with you using it, but as long as your server has a  "no unfair advantage" policy, they may allow it.

When you open a villager trading window, you'll get a list of all item trades the villager offers next to it. This list includs enchantments in the case of smiths and librarians, and shows you at a glance which trades are enabled and which aren't. Clicking on a trade will execute it once, without you needing to move items to/from the merchant UI.
